now data gets copied like : `9B 1F B8 BF 5C 41 EC 50 1C 18 5D 57 61 F1 81 B5`
instead of : `9b1fb8bf5c41ec501c185d5761f181b5`

which is more readable

Just something which I preferred you can make more changes like making options way you want to copy
Many more things can be done , Just be Creative ðŸ˜Š
